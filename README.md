# lazy-ecs

A CLI tool for navigating AWS ECS clusters interactively.

![lazy-ecs demo](images/lazy-ecs-demo.jpg)

## Why I Built This

When running services in ECS, I constantly needed to check:

- What exactly is running where?
- Is my service healthy?
- What parameters or environment variables got applied?
- What do the latest logs show - did the container start as expected?

The AWS ECS web console is confusing to navigate, with multiple clicks through different screens just to get basic information. The AWS CLI is powerful but verbose and requires memorizing complex commands.

**lazy-ecs** solves this with a simple, interactive CLI that lets you quickly drill down from clusters ‚Üí services ‚Üí tasks ‚Üí containers with just arrow keys. It destroys the AWS CLI in usability for ECS exploration and debugging.

## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
# Add the tap
brew tap vertti/lazy-ecs

# Install lazy-ecs
brew install lazy-ecs

# Run it
lazy-ecs
```

### From Source

```bash
# Clone and install with uv
git clone https://github.com/vertti/lazy-ecs.git
cd lazy-ecs
uv sync
uv run lazy-ecs
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

Install tools with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/):

```bash
mise install
```

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Install pre-commit hooks (runs ruff formatting/linting on commit)
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Run the CLI
uv run lazy-ecs

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Format and lint code (with type annotation enforcement)
uv run ruff format
uv run ruff check --fix

# Type checking with pyrefly
uv run pyrefly check

# Auto-add missing type annotations
uv run pyrefly infer

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov
```
