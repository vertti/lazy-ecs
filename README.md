# lazy-ecs

A CLI tool for navigating AWS ECS clusters interactively.

![lazy-ecs demo](images/lazy-ecs-demo.jpg)

## Why I Built This

When running services in ECS, I constantly needed to check:

- What exactly is running where?
- Is my service healthy?
- What parameters or environment variables got applied?
- What do the latest logs show - did the container start as expected?

The AWS ECS web console is confusing to navigate, with multiple clicks through different screens just to get basic information. The AWS CLI is powerful but verbose and requires memorizing complex commands.

**lazy-ecs** solves this with a simple, interactive CLI that lets you quickly drill down from clusters → services → tasks → containers with just arrow keys. It destroys the AWS CLI in usability for ECS exploration and debugging.

## Installation

### Homebrew

```bash
# Add the tap
brew tap vertti/lazy-ecs

# Install lazy-ecs
brew install lazy-ecs

# Run it
lazy-ecs
```

### pipx

[pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) installs Python CLI tools in isolated environments:

```bash
# Install pipx if you haven't already
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath

# Install lazy-ecs
pipx install lazy-ecs

# Run it
lazy-ecs
```

### Docker

Run lazy-ecs using Docker without installing Python:

```bash
# With aws-vault (temporary credentials)
aws-vault exec your-profile -- docker run -it --rm \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN -e AWS_REGION \
  vertti/lazy-ecs

# With IAM credentials (long-lived)
docker run -it --rm \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY -e AWS_REGION \
  vertti/lazy-ecs

# With AWS credentials file
docker run -it --rm -v ~/.aws:/home/lazyecs/.aws:ro vertti/lazy-ecs

# With specific profile
docker run -it --rm -v ~/.aws:/home/lazyecs/.aws:ro -e AWS_PROFILE=your-profile vertti/lazy-ecs
```

**Pro tip:** Create an alias for easier usage:

```bash
# Add to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias lazy-ecs-docker='docker run -it --rm -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN -e AWS_REGION vertti/lazy-ecs'

# Then use with aws-vault
aws-vault exec your-profile -- lazy-ecs-docker
```

### From Source

```bash
# Clone and install with uv
git clone https://github.com/vertti/lazy-ecs.git
cd lazy-ecs
uv sync
uv run lazy-ecs
```

## AWS Authentication

lazy-ecs supports multiple ways to authenticate with AWS:

### 1. AWS Profile (--profile flag)

```bash
lazy-ecs --profile your-profile-name
```

### 2. Environment Variables

```bash
export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=your-profile-name
lazy-ecs
```

### 3. AWS Vault

```bash
aws-vault exec Platform-Test.AWSAdministratorAccess -- lazy-ecs
```

### 4. Default Credentials Chain

lazy-ecs will automatically use the standard AWS credentials chain:

- Environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
- AWS credentials file (~/.aws/credentials)
- IAM instance profile (when running on EC2)

## Features

### Container-Level Features

- ✅ **Container log viewing** - Display recent logs with timestamps from CloudWatch
- ✅ **Container log live tail viewing** - Real-time log streaming with instant keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ **Log filtering** - CloudWatch filter patterns (include/exclude) during live tail
- ✅ **Basic container details** - Show container name, image, CPU/memory configuration
- ✅ **Show environment variables & secrets** - Display environment variables and secrets configuration (without exposing secret values)
- ✅ **Show port mappings** - Display container port configurations and networking
- ✅ **Show volume mounts** - Display file system mounts and storage configuration
- ⬜ **Show resource limits vs usage** - Compare allocated CPU/memory with actual consumption to right-size containers
- ⬜ **Show health check configuration** - Display health check settings and current status
- ⬜ **Connect to running container** - Execute shell commands inside running containers (skip - against immutable philosophy)
- ⬜ **Export container environment** - Save environment variables to .env file for local development
- ⬜ **Copy container command** - Get exact docker run command for local debugging

### Task-Level Features

- ✅ **Task selection with auto-selection** - Automatically select single tasks, interactive selection for multiple
- ✅ **Comprehensive task details** - Display task definition, status, containers, creation time
- ✅ **Task definition version tracking** - Show if task is running desired vs outdated version
- ✅ **Show task events/history** - Display task lifecycle events and failure reasons with smart analysis (OOM kills, timeouts, image pull failures)
- ⬜ **Show task placement details** - Display placement constraints and actual host placement
- ⬜ **Task definition comparison** - Compare current vs desired task definition versions
- ⬜ **Show security groups** - Display networking and security configuration
- ⬜ **Export task definition** - Save task definition as JSON/YAML files
- ⬜ **Stop/Restart single task** - Force restart of a wedged task without redeploying entire service (ECS auto-restarts stopped tasks)
- ⬜ **Quick task failure reason** - Show failure reason inline without navigation

### Service-Level Features

- ✅ **Service browsing with status** - Display services with health indicators (healthy/scaling/over-scaled)
- ✅ **Service status indicators** - Show running/desired/pending counts with visual status
- ✅ **Force new deployment** - Trigger service redeployment directly from CLI (no more AWS console trips!)
- ✅ **Show service events** - Display service-level events and deployment status with chronological sorting and proper categorization
- ⬜ **Show deployment history** - Display service deployment timeline and rollback options
- ⬜ **Show auto-scaling configuration** - Display scaling policies and current metrics
- ⬜ **Show load balancer health** - Display target group health and routing configuration
- ⬜ **Service update (image tag)** - Deploy new image version without leaving CLI
- ⬜ **Service update (environment)** - Update environment variables for service

### Cluster-Level Features

- ✅ **Interactive cluster selection** - Arrow key navigation through available ECS clusters
- ✅ **Log group discovery** - Automatically find relevant log groups for debugging
- ⬜ **Multi-cluster support** - Compare resources across clusters
- ⬜ **Bulk operations across clusters** - Perform operations on multiple clusters

### Advanced Features

- ⬜ **Enhanced log features**:
  - ✅ Search/filter logs by keywords (CloudWatch patterns with include/exclude)
  - ✅ Follow logs in real-time (tail -f style) with responsive keyboard shortcuts
  - ⬜ Download logs to file
- ⬜ **Monitoring integration**:
  - ✅ Show CloudWatch metrics (CPU/Memory utilization) - Display current values, averages, and peaks
  - ⬜ Add sparkline visualization - Inline Unicode trend indicators for quick visual assessment
- ⬜ **Port forwarding to container** - Direct local connection to container ports for debugging
- ⬜ **Multi-region support** - Work with ECS across different AWS regions

### Quality of Life Features

- ✅ **Open resource in AWS console** - One-key shortcut to open current cluster/service/task in browser
